    <h1>Welcome to Payroll</h1>
    <p>The Payroll Management System is designed to 
      automate and simplify the process of managing employee salaries, 
      attendance, and related financial records within an organization. 
      This system ensures accurate calculation of employee wages based on working hours, deductions, bonuses, and allowances.
      It provides secure data storage and easy retrieval of employee details, payment history, and tax information.
      The project includes both web and mobile interfaces for administrators and employees, 
      offering functionalities such as login authentication, employee data management, salary slip generation, 
      and payroll report generation. By reducing manual effort and minimizing errors, the system enhances efficiency, 
      transparency, and reliability in payroll operations.</p>
